# My WW3 Game
## Initial Plans

50 v 50 format 
### Factions/teams
    - 2 main factions
        - multiple subfactions that have different perks/passives.

### Objective
    - a team has a certain amount of points needed to win.
    - gain points by winning gamemodes like TDM, HardPoint, and other team based gamemodes (Not 50 v 50, restricted size).
        - winning these gains two different currencies: Support and Money
    -smaller quests throughout the main map to earn reputation money or support
    -use cash to upgrade technology, whether it be war, travel, or home technology(TBD)
### Currencies
    -Support
        - More Support, better and faster technology is improved
        - lost over time
        - initial support depends on the sub faction
    -cash
        - needed to upgrade and gain new technologies
        - can be earned through gamemode or quest
    -Reputation
        - used to get higher reputations.
        - some technologies are locked through reputation.
        - allows for more challenging quests which gives more rewards
            - loses reputation for a failed quest
        - DOES NOT AFFECT MAIN GAMEMODES
### Features
    - save game( possibly if not then make it a smaller # like 10 v 10 or 20 v 20)
    - choose a faction then a subfaction
    - Initial plans for a game to span a couple hours to a day ( this part is similar to COC where it isn't a get in a game win and restart.)
    - An overall level system. 
### Maps and Gamemodes
    - Team DeathMatch
        - More Open and fast pased ( makes for a fast gamemode))

        - can be hectic or slow. 
    - more gamemodes to be added.
