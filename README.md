# Title IN Progress
## Initial Plans

### Factions/teams
    - 2 main factions
        - multiple subfactions that have different perks/passives.

### Objective
    - a team has a certain amount of points needed to win.
    - gain points by winning gamemodes like TDM, HardPoint, and other team based gamemodes (Not 50 v 50, restricted size).
        - winning these gains two different currencies: Support and Money
    -smaller quests throughout the main map to earn reputation money or support
    -use cash to upgrade technology, whether it be war, travel, or home technology(TBD)

### Currencies
    -Support
        - More Support, better and faster technology is improved
        - lost over time
        - initial support depends on the sub faction
    -cash
        - needed to upgrade and gain new technologies
        - can be earned through gamemode or quest
    -Reputation
        - used to get higher reputations.
        - some technologies are locked through reputation.
        - allows for more challenging quests which gives more rewards
            - loses reputation for a failed quest
        - DOES NOT AFFECT MAIN GAMEMODES

### Features
    - save game( possibly if not then make it a smaller # like 10 v 10 or 20 v 20)
    - choose a faction then a subfaction
    - Initial plans for a game to span a couple hours to a day ( this part is similar to COC where it isn't a get in a game win and restart.)
    - An overall level system.

### Maps and Gamemodes
    - Team DeathMatch
        - More Open and fast pased ( makes for a fast gamemode))
    - HardPoint/King of the Hill 
        - Traditional three lane hardpoint map from COD. 
    - Defence
        - Focuses more on camping/defensive map
        - one team has to defend a point while the other has to capture it. 
        - can be hectic or slow. 
    - Escape
        - One team is the guards and the other team is the jail breakers
        - Jailbreakers must break prisoner out of jail and to the LZ safely. 
        - The guards must capture the prisoner back or prevent the jailbreakers from freeing the prisoner.
        - The guards can kill the jail breakers but not the prisoner.
        - prisoner is unarmed and cant move unless there is a jailbreaker within range.
        - jailbreakers could be killed but capturing gives a bonus, like at the end of round or something in round like a speed boost.
        - Captured Jailbreakers have opportunities to escape, but it is very hard. 
        - killed jailbreakers respawn after a bit, but only if there are at least one jail breaker alive, Not including the prisoner.
    - Escape: Traitor ( not entirely flushed out)
        - Similar to Escape, but one of the guards is a traitor
        - names are hidden, and Jailbreaker have less people due to having the traitor.
        - guards know there is a traitor, but do not know who.
        - traitor is trying to help the jail breakers without getting caught. 
        - if traitor is caught before a certain period, the jail breakers lose.
        - Traitor can't damage guards until a certain point in time. 
    - more gamemodes to be added.
     
### Quests
    - Gets more challenging the more reputation
    - Quests are primarily solo or a party of 2.
